# Machine-Learning-Project_-Classification-of-Fashion-MNIST-images
Built logistic regression, Random Forest, MLP, and 2D CNN models for classification tasks on Fashion MNIST image datasets by using PyTorch and Keras
2D CNN proved to have the highest accuracy, while logistic regression reported the lowest accuracy
